    <p>The gentle giant of the farm, the cow, is a domesticated herbivore with a surprisingly complex history. With large, expressive eyes and a calm demeanor, cows have been revered and utilized by humans for millennia. Their primary contribution lies in their milk, a rich source of protein and calcium that forms the base of countless dairy products like cheese, butter, and yogurt. Beyond their culinary significance, cows have also played a crucial role in agriculture, pulling plows and tilling fields, their dung used as a natural fertilizer.
